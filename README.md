## About this app. Functionality.

This application was designed to allow user to track their daily tasks via time sheet. The sheet displays from 9AM to 5PM and will color code dependent on what time it currently is. The current day of the week, time in hours and minutes, and date are displayed at the top of the page underneath the title. User may enter text into the center column at the appropriate hour of which they need to do their task and then press the save button which is the furthest right column of the three. Pressing the save button will store the users data so that the user may come back to see what tasks they have remaining in the day.
